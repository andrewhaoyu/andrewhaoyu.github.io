      <description>&lt;p&gt;Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are useful for predicting various phenotypes/outcomes; however, most PRS are developed using predominately European ancestry data, their performance in non-European populations is often poorer. To improve PRS performance in non-European populations, we propose TDLD-SLEB (Two-Dimensional Clumping and thresholDing with Super Learning and Empirical Bayes), which takes advantage of both existing large GWAS from European populations and smaller GWAS from non-European populations. TDLD-SLEB leverages the genetic correlations across populations while accounting for the linkage disequilibrium (LD) differences and population-specific allele frequencies. We found TDLD-SLEB had outperformed alternative methods through large scale simulations with different genetic architectures. Using 23andMe, Inc. data, we applied TDLD-SLEB for seven complex traits using GWAS data from five ethnic groups (average N≈ 3,108K per trait). TDLD-SLEB often led to large improvement in PRS performance compared to alternative methods for African American population (e.g., for height, R2 = 0.12 for TDLD-SLEB vs. R2 = 0.05 for weighted PRS method).  For other ethnic groups, TDLD-SLEB also led to sometime notable improvements in PRS performance, such as for cardiovascular disease in the Latino population (AUC = 0.61 for TDLD-SLEB vs. AUC = 0.58 for weighed PRS method).  In conclusion, TDLD-SLEB is a computationally scalable and statistically efficient method for generating predictive PRS in non-European populations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Testing for genetic association association and building risk prediction models for cancer incorporating tumor characteristics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer represents a heterogeneous group of diseases with different molecular and clinical features. Thus, clarifying potential heterogeneous associations between genes and disease subtypes offers a tremendous opportunity to characterize distinct etiological pathways. During my graduate studies, I proposed several new computational and statistical approaches to develop powerful genetic associations tests and build polygenic risk scores for specific subtypes. This method has 1) discovered 32 novel susceptibility loci associated with breast cancer risk; 2) revealed the complex etiological heterogeneity patterns of 173 known risk loci; and 3) constructed PRS with the best prediction performance for different breast cancer subtypes. This work has led to three first-authored papers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zhang, Haoyu, et al. &amp;ldquo;Genome-wide association study identifies 32 novel breast cancer susceptibility loci from overall and subtype-specific analyses.&amp;rdquo; Nature genetics 52.6 (2020): 572-581. (co-first author)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zhang, Haoyu, et al. &amp;ldquo;A mixed-model approach for powerful testing of genetic associations with cancer risk incorporating tumor characteristics.&amp;rdquo; Biostatistics 22.4 (2020): 772-788.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ahearn, Thomas U., et al. &amp;ldquo;Common breast cancer risk loci predispose to distinct tumor subtypes.&amp;rdquo; (Accepted at Breast Cancer Research, co-first author)&lt;/li&gt;
