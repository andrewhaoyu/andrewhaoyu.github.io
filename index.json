Currently, I am interested in addressing the weak intruments bias in Mendelian Randomization, developing multi-ethnic polygenic risk scores, and quantifying the COVID-19 tranmission pattern on U.S. states and county level data.\nI received my Ph.D. from the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health under the guidance of Nilanjan Chatterjee and Ni Zhao. I also received the graduate student fellowship from National Cancer Institute under the guidance of Montserrat Garc√≠a-Closas. My Phd dissertation focused on testing for genetic association and building risk prediction models for cancer incorporating tumor characteristics. I led several multidisciplinary international collaborations using the largest breast cancer GWAS dataset from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/author/haoyu-zhang/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/haoyu-zhang/","section":"authors","summary":"Welcome to my homepage!
