We conducted complementary observational and Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses to determine whether history of gallstones is causally related to development of GBC in an Indian population. Methods: To investigate associations between history of gallstones and GBC, we used questionnaire and imaging data from a GBC case-control study conducted at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai (cases=1170; controls=2525). We then used 26 genetic variants identified in a genome-wide association study of 27,174 gallstones cases and 736,838 controls of European ancestry in a Mendelian randomization approach to assess causality. The association of these genetic variants with both gallstones and GBC was examined in the GBC case-control study. Various complementary MR approaches were used to evaluate the robustness of our results in the presence of pleiotropy and heterogeneity, and to consider the suitability of the selected SNPs as genetic instruments for gallstones in an Indian population. Results: We found a strong observational association between gallstones and GBC using self-reported history of gallstones (OR=4.5, 95%CI=3.5-5.8) and with objective measures of gallstone presence using imaging techniques (OR=2.0, 95%CI=1.5-2.7). We found consistent causal estimates across all MR techniques, with odds ratios for GBC in the range of 1.3-1.6. Conclusions: Our findings indicate a causal relationship between history of gallstones and increased risk of GBC, albeit of a smaller magnitude to those found in observational analysis. Impact: Our findings emphasise the importance of gallstone treatment for preventing GBC in high risk individuals.","tags":["Cancer Epidemiology"],"title":"The role of gallstones in gallbladder cancer in India: a Mendelian randomization study","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600675200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600675200,"objectID":"95746925132d3bb2a22b46538a511d6c","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/talk/bcac_2020/","publishdate":"2020-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/bcac_2020/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Statistical Genetics"],"title":"Methods for developing ancestry specific polygenic risk scores","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596362400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596362400,"objectID":"ec8d7ea334e71da6e0237024803e5509","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/talk/jsm_2020/","publishdate":"2020-08-02T10:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/jsm_2020/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Statistical Genetics","Causal Inference analysis"],"title":"Robust Mendelian randomization analysis with weak instruments","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Yan D.

All cancers show a high degree of polygenicity, involving at a minimum of thousands of loci. We project that sample sizes required to explain 80% of GWAS heritability vary from 60,000 cases for testicular to over 1,000,000 cases for lung cancer. The maximum relative risk achievable for subjects at the 99th risk percentile of underlying polygenic risk scores (PRS), compared to average risk, ranges from 12 for testicular to 2.5 for ovarian cancer.

IARC noted, however, an increased risk of bladder cancer (based on limited evidence). Objective: To evaluate the association between quantitative, lifetime occupational diesel exhaust exposure and risk of urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder (UBC) overall and according to pathological subtypes. Methods: Data from personal interviews with 1944 UBC cases, as well as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue blocks, and 2135 controls were pooled from two case-control studies conducted in the U.S. and Spain. Lifetime occupational histories combined with exposure-oriented questions were used to estimate cumulative exposure to respirable elemental carbon (REC), a primary surrogate for diesel exhaust. Unconditional logistic regression and two-stage polytomous logistic regression were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for smoking and other risk factors. Results: Exposure to cumulative REC was associated with an increased risk of UBC; workers with cumulative REC 396 μg/m3-years had an OR of 1.61 (95% CI, 1.08-2.40). At this level of cumulative exposure, similar results were observed in the U.S. and Spain, OR = 1.75 (95% CI, 0.97-3.15) and OR = 1.54 (95% CI, 0.89-2.68), respectively. In lagged analysis, we also observed a consistent increased risk among workers with cumulative REC 396 μg/m3-years (range of ORs = 1.52-1.93) for all lag intervals evaluated (5-40 years). When we accounted for tumor subtypes defined by stage and grade, a significant association between diesel exhaust exposure and UBC was apparent (global test for association p = 0.0019). Conclusions: Combining data from two large epidemiologic studies, our results provide further evidence that diesel exhaust exposure increases the risk of UBC.","tags":["Cancer Epidemiology"],"title":"Diesel exhaust and bladder cancer risk by pathologic stage and grade subtypes","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579100400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579100400,"objectID":"237e0d36bb88ca86446a84b0c28c7803","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/talk/chengdu_2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/chengdu_2020/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Statistical Genetics"],"title":" A mixed-model approach for powerful testing of genetic associations with cancer risk incorporating tumor characteristics","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577458800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577458800,"objectID":"32f3b79428facb0b0f9bcc7130827200","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/talk/shanghai_2020/","publishdate":"2019-12-27T15:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/shanghai_2020/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Statistical Genetics"],"title":"A mixed-model approach for powerful testing of genetic associations with cancer risk incorporating tumor characteristics","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564786800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564786800,"objectID":"b7d361157407660467fa06de48f3ae51","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/honors/asa_2019/","publishdate":"2019-08-03T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/honors/asa_2019/","section":"honors","summary":"American Statistical Association Section on Statistics in Genomics and Genetics","tags":null,"title":"Distinguished Student Paper Award","type":"honors"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564754400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564754400,"objectID":"479bf42757d5e49d523e5f473ae5b801","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/talk/jsm_2019/","publishdate":"2019-08-02T02:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/jsm_2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A mixed-model approach for powerful testing of genetic associations with cancer risk incorporating tumor characteristics","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556665200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556665200,"objectID":"c3d80379f4f8eb2a462f99d4a47f8a51","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/honors/delta_omega_scholarship/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/honors/delta_omega_scholarship/","section":"honors","summary":"Johns Hopkins University","tags":null,"title":"Delta Omega Scholarship","type":"honors"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555426800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555426800,"objectID":"94534698d0649cd83180f7f25575f957","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/talk/bcac_2019/","publishdate":"2019-04-16T15:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/bcac_2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Statistical Genetics"],"title":"Subtypes specific GWAS and risk prediction modeling on breast cancer subtypes","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554073200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554073200,"objectID":"fd076148949bfd1c342d1b6f4376d75d","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/honors/delta_omega_honor/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/honors/delta_omega_honor/","section":"honors","summary":"Johns Hopkins University","tags":null,"title":"Delta Omega Public Health Honor Society, Alpha Chapter","type":"honors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1552604400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552604400,"objectID":"978bc346f5671acda60c61af2de0e8ee","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/honors/dublin/","publishdate":"2019-03-15T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/honors/dublin/","section":"honors","summary":"Johns Hopkins University","tags":null,"title":"Louis I. and Thomas D.

And what mechanism does the principal structure rely on to prevent the superior translation of the humeral head, the spacer effect or the tensional hammock effect? Methods: Eight shoulder specimens were assessed using a custom biomechanical testing system. Glenohumeral superior translation and subacromial peak pressure were compared using 6 models: the intact joint model, supraspinatus dysfunction model, supraspinatus defect model, SC tear model, SC defect model, and irreparable rotator cuff tear (IRCT) model. Results: Compared with the intact joint model, the supraspinatus defect model significantly increased the superior translation (by 2.6 mm; P .05). Conclusions: The anatomic SC has a negligible role in preventing the superior translation of the humeral head. Clinical relevance: SC reconstruction is not a simple anatomic reconstruction, and its promising clinical outcome may be due to tensional fixation technique and choice of graft.","tags":["Clinical

Modeling COVID-19 transmission dynamics faces significant challenges. A large number of cases are likely to be un-ascertained/undetected due to insufficient testing. Many of these un-ascertained cases are asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic but still infectious. For a given region, the unknown ascertainment rate often varies over time due to evolving testing capacity. Furthermore, case counts are often subject to delayed reporting. Epidemic models that ignore unascertained cases and reporting delays can lead to biased estimates of the transmission rate and the prevalence of the disease. To address these problems, we develop an over-dispersed Poisson Partial Differential Equation transmission dynamic model to estimate the region-specific Rt and ascertainment rates as piece-wise constants by (1) using daily case counts of positive tests and accounting for both reporting delay and over-dispersion; (2) incorporating daily death count data; (3) modeling the compartments of isolation at home and at hospitals separately. We also estimate the prevalence and the daily numbers of total infections in a given region by accounting for under-ascertainment. We apply the model to 50 U.S. states and more than 200 countries using data up to August 31th, 2020. Our results show that ascertainment rates continue increase as the testing capacity increase. However, there are still large proportion of unascertained COVID-19 cases.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"764eec25694ae9d4c8df4ab56dc1dfd0","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/research/covid_19/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/covid_19/","section":"research","summary":"Understanding COVID-19 transmission dynamics, such as the time-varying effective reproductive numbers (Rt), is important for controlling the disease, estimating the prevalence and the total number of infections, and the fatality.
