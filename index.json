We conducted complementary observational and Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses to determine whether history of gallstones is causally related to development of GBC in an Indian population. Methods: To investigate associations between history of gallstones and GBC, we used questionnaire and imaging data from a GBC case-control study conducted at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai (cases=1170; controls=2525). We then used 26 genetic variants identified in a genome-wide association study of 27,174 gallstones cases and 736,838 controls of European ancestry in a Mendelian randomization approach to assess causality. The association of these genetic variants with both gallstones and GBC was examined in the GBC case-control study. Various complementary MR approaches were used to evaluate the robustness of our results in the presence of pleiotropy and heterogeneity, and to consider the suitability of the selected SNPs as genetic instruments for gallstones in an Indian population. Results: We found a strong observational association between gallstones and GBC using self-reported history of gallstones (OR=4.5, 95%CI=3.5-5.8) and with objective measures of gallstone presence using imaging techniques (OR=2.0, 95%CI=1.5-2.7). We found consistent causal estimates across all MR techniques, with odds ratios for GBC in the range of 1.3-1.6. Conclusions: Our findings indicate a causal relationship between history of gallstones and increased risk of GBC, albeit of a smaller magnitude to those found in observational analysis. Impact: Our findings emphasise the importance of gallstone treatment for preventing GBC in high risk individuals.","tags":["Cancer Epidemiology"],"title":"The role of gallstones in gallbladder cancer in India: a Mendelian randomization study","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600675200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600675200,"objectID":"95746925132d3bb2a22b46538a511d6c","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/talk/bcac_2020/","publishdate":"2020-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/bcac_2020/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Statistical Genetics"],"title":"Methods for developing ancestry specific polygenic risk scores","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596362400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596362400,"objectID":"ec8d7ea334e71da6e0237024803e5509","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/talk/jsm_2020/","publishdate":"2020-08-02T10:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/jsm_2020/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Statistical Genetics","Causal Inference analysis"],"title":"Robust Mendelian randomization analysis with weak instruments","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Yan D.

Here we analyse summary-level data from GWAS of European ancestry across fourteen cancer sites to estimate the number of common susceptibility variants (polygenicity) and underlying effect-size distribution. All cancers show a high degree of polygenicity, involving at a minimum of thousands of loci. We project that sample sizes required to explain 80% of GWAS heritability vary from 60,000 cases for testicular to over 1,000,000 cases for lung cancer. The maximum relative risk achievable for subjects at the 99th risk percentile of underlying polygenic risk scores (PRS), compared to average risk, ranges from 12 for testicular to 2.5 for ovarian cancer. We show that PRS have potential for risk stratification for cancers of breast, colon and prostate, but less so for others because of modest heritability and lower incidence.","tags":["Statistical Genetics"],"title":"Assessment of polygenic architecture and risk prediction based on common variants across fourteen cancers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas U.

IARC noted, however, an increased risk of bladder cancer (based on limited evidence). Objective: To evaluate the association between quantitative, lifetime occupational diesel exhaust exposure and risk of urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder (UBC) overall and according to pathological subtypes. Methods: Data from personal interviews with 1944 UBC cases, as well as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue blocks, and 2135 controls were pooled from two case-control studies conducted in the U.S. and Spain. Lifetime occupational histories combined with exposure-oriented questions were used to estimate cumulative exposure to respirable elemental carbon (REC), a primary surrogate for diesel exhaust. Unconditional logistic regression and two-stage polytomous logistic regression were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for smoking and other risk factors. Results: Exposure to cumulative REC was associated with an increased risk of UBC; workers with cumulative REC 396 μg/m3-years had an OR of 1.61 (95% CI, 1.08-2.40). At this level of cumulative exposure, similar results were observed in the U.S. and Spain, OR = 1.75 (95% CI, 0.97-3.15) and OR = 1.54 (95% CI, 0.89-2.68), respectively. In lagged analysis, we also observed a consistent increased risk among workers with cumulative REC 396 μg/m3-years (range of ORs = 1.52-1.93) for all lag intervals evaluated (5-40 years). When we accounted for tumor subtypes defined by stage and grade, a significant association between diesel exhaust exposure and UBC was apparent (global test for association p = 0.0019). Conclusions: Combining data from two large epidemiologic studies, our results provide further evidence that diesel exhaust exposure increases the risk of UBC.","tags":["Cancer Epidemiology"],"title":"Diesel exhaust and bladder cancer risk by pathologic stage and grade subtypes","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579100400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579100400,"objectID":"237e0d36bb88ca86446a84b0c28c7803","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/talk/chengdu_2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/chengdu_2020/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Statistical Genetics"],"title":" A mixed-model approach for powerful testing of genetic associations with cancer risk incorporating tumor characteristics","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577458800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577458800,"objectID":"32f3b79428facb0b0f9bcc7130827200","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/talk/shanghai_2020/","publishdate":"2019-12-27T15:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/shanghai_2020/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Statistical Genetics"],"title":"A mixed-model approach for powerful testing of genetic associations with cancer risk incorporating tumor characteristics","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564786800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564786800,"objectID":"b7d361157407660467fa06de48f3ae51","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/honors/asa_2019/","publishdate":"2019-08-03T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/honors/asa_2019/","section":"honors","summary":"American Statistical Association Section on Statistics in Genomics and Genetics","tags":null,"title":"Distinguished Student Paper Award","type":"honors"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564754400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564754400,"objectID":"479bf42757d5e49d523e5f473ae5b801","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/talk/jsm_2019/","publishdate":"2019-08-02T02:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/jsm_2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A mixed-model approach for powerful testing of genetic associations with cancer risk incorporating tumor characteristics","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556665200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556665200,"objectID":"c3d80379f4f8eb2a462f99d4a47f8a51","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/honors/delta_omega_scholarship/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/honors/delta_omega_scholarship/","section":"honors","summary":"Johns Hopkins University","tags":null,"title":"Delta Omega Scholarship","type":"honors"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555426800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555426800,"objectID":"94534698d0649cd83180f7f25575f957","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/talk/bcac_2019/","publishdate":"2019-04-16T15:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/bcac_2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Statistical Genetics"],"title":"Subtypes specific GWAS and risk prediction modeling on breast cancer subtypes","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554073200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554073200,"objectID":"fd076148949bfd1c342d1b6f4376d75d","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/honors/delta_omega_honor/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/honors/delta_omega_honor/","section":"honors","summary":"Johns Hopkins University","tags":null,"title":"Delta Omega Public Health Honor Society, Alpha Chapter","type":"honors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1552604400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552604400,"objectID":"978bc346f5671acda60c61af2de0e8ee","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/honors/dublin/","publishdate":"2019-03-15T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/honors/dublin/","section":"honors","summary":"Johns Hopkins University","tags":null,"title":"Louis I. and Thomas D.

And what mechanism does the principal structure rely on to prevent the superior translation of the humeral head, the spacer effect or the tensional hammock effect? Methods: Eight shoulder specimens were assessed using a custom biomechanical testing system. Glenohumeral superior translation and subacromial peak pressure were compared using 6 models: the intact joint model, supraspinatus dysfunction model, supraspinatus defect model, SC tear model, SC defect model, and irreparable rotator cuff tear (IRCT) model. Results: Compared with the intact joint model, the supraspinatus defect model significantly increased the superior translation (by 2.6 mm; P .05). Conclusions: The anatomic SC has a negligible role in preventing the superior translation of the humeral head. Clinical relevance: SC reconstruction is not a simple anatomic reconstruction, and its promising clinical outcome may be due to tensional fixation technique and choice of graft.","tags":["Clinical

Finally, we provide insights into the required quality of annotation/functional information for identification of likely causal variants to make meaningful improvement in power.","tags":["Statistical Genetics"],"title":"Power Analysis for Genetic Association Test (PAGEANT) provides insights to challenges for rare variant association studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506938400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506938400,"objectID":"41228e3ab95263156bccaefd2f30188a","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/talk/ashg_2017/","publishdate":"2017-10-02T10:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ashg_2017/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Statistical Genetics"],"title":"Genome-wide association study (GWAS) identifies 19 novel breast cancer loci from analyses accounting for subtype heterogeneity","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504951200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504951200,"objectID":"c3e7a3d445d70494d62dce17e5a03c41","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/talk/nci_2017/","publishdate":"2017-09-09T10:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/nci_2017/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Testing for genetic associations in case-control studies incorporating multivariate disease characteristics","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1501637400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1501637400,"objectID":"c4e1147afad4c5229ed3f6b419e7cfdb","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/talk/jsm_2017/","publishdate":"2017-08-02T01:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/jsm_2017/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Statistical Genetics"],"title":"Testing for genetic associations in case-control studies incorporating multivariate disease characteristics","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496271600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496271600,"objectID":"a07f1b3ce8f247459bfade421b947de9","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/honors/sages/","publishdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/honors/sages/","section":"honors","summary":"University of Pennsylvania","tags":null,"title":"Symposium on Advances in Genomics, Epidemiology, and Statistics (SAGES) Poster Award","type":"honors"},{"authors":["Sharayu Mhatre","Zhaoming Wang","Rajini Nagrani","Rajendra Badwe","Shubhada Chiplunkar","Balraj Mittal","Saurabh Yadav","Others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1491004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491004800,"objectID":"0ebc7f79f44a68ea3072253d8ce7e0df","permalink":"https://andrewhaoyu.github.io/publication/gallbladder_gwas/","publishdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gallbladder_gwas/","section":"publication","summary":"This is the first GWAS of gallbladder cancer in India.
